# üëã Hi there!

I worked on this project to learn about the **Redux-thunk middleware concept** within my Redux projects. During this project, I used the **API** from **'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com'**. This work helped solidify some concepts in my mind. I want to continue working with the Redux-thunk middleware to become more proficient in it. In the future, I also plan to explore other popular middleware like Redux-logger.

My goal with this repository is to fully understand Redux state management and integrate it into my future projects.

## Here are the resources I used for this project:

üñ•Ô∏è These resources helped me better understand the middleware concept. If you're also **looking to learn Redux and need a guide**, feel free to explore the branches in this repo. I include different resources in each branch, along with the source code. I hope they are helpful to you. _Happy coding!_
