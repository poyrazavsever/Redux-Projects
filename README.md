# Learning Redux and Redux Toolkit

Welcome to the **Learning** branch of the Redux-Projects repository! This branch is dedicated to documenting my learning journey with Redux and Redux Toolkit. Here, I will be sharing various notes, code snippets, and mini-projects that I created while exploring different concepts and techniques.

## Purpose

The main goal of this branch is to serve as a learning log where I can document my progress and share insights gained throughout the learning process. It includes:

- **Code Snippets**: Small code examples that demonstrate specific Redux and Redux Toolkit concepts.
- **Mini-Projects**: Small applications or modules designed to practice and reinforce my understanding of Redux principles.
- **Notes**: Written explanations and comments to clarify why certain approaches were taken and what I learned from them.

## Branch Structure

- **Code Snippets**: Organized by topic, such as actions, reducers, middleware, and store configuration.
- **Mini-Projects**: Each mini-project has its own directory with a README explaining the project's purpose and what I learned.
- **Notes**: Written in Markdown files, grouped by topics or chapters of my learning journey.
