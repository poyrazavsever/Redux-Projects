# 📊 Hello
Today, the Redux project I worked on was a todo app. I used CRUD operations such as adding, updating, and deleting. This work has greatly helped me understand Redux.

## 🛠️ What is CRUD?
CRUD stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**, which are the four basic operations you can perform on data in a database or any persistent storage system.

## 📋 What is a Todo App?
A todo app is a simple application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, update them, or delete them. Todo apps are a great way to practice state management and CRUD operations in software development.
