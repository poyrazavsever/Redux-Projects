# üìä Hello

Today, I added CRUD operations to my previous project.

### üõ†Ô∏è First of all, what is CRUD?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations you can perform on data in a database or any persistent storage system. Here's a breakdown of each operation:

Create: This operation involves adding new data to the database. For instance, when you sign up on a website, your information is created and stored in the database.

Read: The read operation is about retrieving or fetching data from the database. This could be as simple as viewing a list of users on a platform.

Update: This operation allows you to modify existing data. For example, editing your profile information on a website involves updating your data in the database.

Delete: As the name suggests, the delete operation is used to remove data from the database. For instance, when you delete a post on social media, it is removed from the platform's database.

Together, these operations form the foundation of interacting with data in most applications, making CRUD an essential concept in software development.

Through the work I've done in this repository, I feel that I've laid a solid foundation for understanding Redux. My goal with this repository is to fully grasp Redux state management and incorporate it into my future projects.
